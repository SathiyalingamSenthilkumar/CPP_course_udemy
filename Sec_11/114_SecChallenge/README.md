Sectioin - 11 Challenge program:

Your challenge for section 11 is to modularize your solution to the Section 9
challenge by refactoring your solution so that it uses uses functions.
    
You decide how to modularize the program.
you can use my solution which is included in this file, or modularize your solution.
    
DO NOT move the vector object outside main and make it a global variable.
    

- You can start by defining a function that displays the menu
- You can then define a function that reads the selection from the user and returns it in uppercase
- Create functions for each menu option
- Create functions that display the list of numbers, calculates the mean and so forth
        

Take it one function at a time and take your time.
If you get frustrated, take a break -- this isn't as easy as it looks the first time you do it!
    
Finally,  don't forget to use function prototypes!
    
Good luck -- I know you can do it!


The section-9 challenge program:

This challenge is about using a collection (list) of integers and allowing the user
to select options from a menu to perform operations on the list.
    
The program displays display a menu options to the user as follows:
    
    P - Print numbers
    A - Add a number
    M - Display mean of the numbers
    S - Display the smallest number
    L - Display the largest number
    C - Clearing the numbers list
    Q - Quit
