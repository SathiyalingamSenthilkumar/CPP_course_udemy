The section challenge deals with vectors in C++.

- Initilly a 1D Vector is created.
- Then a 2D Vector is created and the 1D vectors are assigned to them.

The elements and sizes are printied usign the at() and size() methods,respectively.

* The 2d vectors won't change when the individual vectors are changed. This is
because the copies are created individually while creating a 2d vector.
